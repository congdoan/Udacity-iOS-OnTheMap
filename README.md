# On The Map v1.0
## "iOS developer" program student submission

*This repo contains my submission for the project "On The Map v1.0" of the "iOS developer" program on udacity.com.*


## App Description
The On The Map app allows users to share their location and a URL with their fellow students. To visualize this data, On The Map uses a map with pins for location and pin annotations for student names and URLs, allowing students to place themselves “on the map,” so to speak.


## App Specification
The spec is described at this page: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tPF1tmSzVYPSbpl7_JCeMKglKMIs3dUa4OrSAKEYNAs/pub?embedded=true
